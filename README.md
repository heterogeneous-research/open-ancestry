# open-ancestry

## The beginnings of something awesome!
The goal of this project is to make a fully-open source ancestry/admixture prediction based on personal genomics data. There is a lot of great software out there, but the vast majority of it is only usable by someone trained in bioinformatics.

## The dream:
Input: *genotype*, from either a genotpying array, whole exome, or whole genome sequence
Output: *ancestry/admixture prediction* in a simple data-structure that anyone can 'build on top of' for instance to make a fully open-sourced ancestry report.

## The reality:
All I have done at the moment is make a super simple ipython notebook that shows how anyone with basic python skills can take their 23andMe data and make a principal components analysis plot and make a (very broad/course-grained) ancestry prediction.

Ideas, collaborations, and pull requests welcome!!!
